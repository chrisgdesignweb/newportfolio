    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>Lead Designer and Design System Advocate throughout the organization. I initiated the creation of the design system and was the Sr Designer on the project. I got buy in from the executive team as well as development team to design and manage a Design System that would bring much needed consistency to the product.  </p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>The AnswerRocket web application has been worked on with just Developers for about 6 years and a single designer for about a year. There were many releases in that time and the UI was never consistent. There wasn't any specific pattern library or system in place for developers to follow, so each single dev was creating and recreating say a button for the application.  </p>

      <div class="offset-by-two eight columns" style="margin-top: 10px">
    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
          <p>Bring consistency to the application's UI with a consistent shared language around design. Have a dedicated space for devs to copy code that would be consistent - ex buttons. Give PM's consistent elements for idea generation mockups and wireframes.  </p>

    <h3>How We Tackled This</h3>
          <p>In the first few weeks of working at AR I was tasked with doing a UX Audit on the product, going through screen by screen to see areas that could be improved by following best UI/UX patterns or being usability tested. At this time I had started to see alot of inconsistency in buttons, forms, modals, etc. </p>

        <p>I quietly started documenting some of this in Milanote and a project plan was bern, see below. </p>
          
          <h4>Project Plan</h4>
          
          <a href="images/plan-audit.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/plan-audit.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" class="u-max-full-width"></a>
          
          <br /><br />
          
        <h3>Inconsistencies</h3>
          <p>The UI had many inconsistencies that were taking away from a great UX and product. Here are just a few examples from the audit:</p>
          
        <h4>Buttons</h4>
          
        <a href="images/buttons.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/buttons.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" class="u-max-full-width"></a>
          <br/><br/>
        <h4>Modals</h4>
          
        <a href="images/modals.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/modals.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" class="u-max-full-width"></a>
          <br/><br/>
        <h4>Typography</h4>
          
        <a href="images/typography.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/typography.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" class="u-max-full-width"></a>
        <br/><br/>
        
                    
        <p>At this time I talked a few developers to see if this is something we could get done as a team. I approached our Head of Product and presented a few design systems and supporting text to try to get buy in. Having this inconsistent UI was costing the organization lots of time and development resources.</p>

        <p>We were mid-sprint, so he mentioned that this is something that I can work on in my downtime, so the design team set out to execute on the audit and start creating design patterns. </p>

    <h3>As Luck Would Have It</h3>
          <p>The stars aligned and AnswerRocket was chosen to be on the big stage at Gartner with the largest competitors in the space: Microsoft BI, Tableau &amp; Qlik to show off their application with one of the categories being "Clean User Interface Design". This was the catalyst for updating the current UI with the consistency that came from a design system and Galaxy was born. We started with typography, colors, buttons &amp;forms and modals.  </p>
        
          <h4>Typography</h4>
          <a href="images/typography-galaxy.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/typography-galaxy.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" class="u-max-full-width"></a>

          <br/><br/>
          <h5>Designing with Accessibility in mind</h5>
        <p>While working on the components and patterns I used <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">Web Aim</a> to constantly be designing with accessibility in mind. Accessibility is not something that is talked about at all at AnswerRocket, but this was my chance to get a start on creating a more accessible product and then start to communicate more across the organazation when the time was right.  We were re-designing new screens for Covid Data to be consumed by Gov't officials in the Gartner Bake-Off. It was a start to steering the organization down the right path. </p>

    <h3>Selling it to the Executives &amp; Dev Team</h3>
          <p>I put together a presentation that included our audit of the current UI along with best practices and benefits of a Design system and presented to the CTO, CEO and Head of Product. I also  found a champion for Galaxy on the Dev team, Mark who has a few front devs working under him and loved the idea. They were using Bootstrap in the past and found it so much easier to manage the Front End. </p>
          
        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
          
          <p>Our approach was to work on a few screens with best UI/UX practices and port the elements back to Galaxy. This was our version 1.0 of the Design System and wasn't ideal, but it was the best process for us. We only had about 3 weeks including development to get the UI in a good place for this Gartner Bake Off. </p>
          
          
          
        <p>For instance, we had to tackle an updated version of our NewsFeed. That includes new icons and reworking some of the  spacing around the top level navigation. Our icon system at time spanned three different libraries with alot of inconsistencies.  Idid a bucnh of research and tried out a few icons systems and landed on Streamline icons. There was an easy way to implement on the front end with an NPM Package, so development was on board as well. </p>
          
        <h4>Icons</h4>

         <h4>NewsFeed Before Galaxy</h4>

         <h4>NewsFeed After Galaxy</h4>

          <br/><br/>
        
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
          
        <p>Although we had buy in from the CEO from the beginning, he started to bring up concerns about areas within the design system that were very established such as colors. We had a few conversations, but had to shelve the talks to push towards this Gartner project. We moved on to other projects and still have not had any discussions around these concerned areas. </p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>I worked closely with one of our Front End Leads, Mark to make sure that everything that was being developed was using Galaxy. Our PM, Stef was also working on QA of this work, lending a hand in making sure that everything was consistent - tracking in Jira. They used a product called Storybook to keep the entire dev team in sync on consistency.  Here they create React components and Mark championed the adoption throughout the Dev team. </p>

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>When we got into QA of some of the UI screens, we noticed that a few of the devs had gone rogue and were not using Galaxy. We quickly setup meetings with those developers and Mark to make sure that all the work we were doing was being implmented on the Dev side.  </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
   <p>The new UI was well recieved in the Gartner demonstration. The NewsFeed especially was impactful when the Covid Data judge had mentioned that it was omne of the most impressive aspects of the Bake Off. The product team worked really hard to get the UI in a better place. </p>

    <h3>Continuing to refine Galaxy post Gartner</h3>
   <p>The Design System v1.0 was finally setup and devs are using it on a daily basis through storybook. The next phases we are working on include more documentation as well as usability testing on various patterns that were implemented in the Gartner UI refresh. I'm currently working on defining our Design Principals as an organization. I'm also working with our Head of Product to get into more talks with the CEO on concerns he may have with various patterns so that we will all be aligned. </p>
          
    <h3>What's Next?</h3>
   <p>Our Jr Designer, Caroline joined another organization and we are down to two designers, so Galaxy will enevatibly take a backseat to the work that must be done in the sprint. I recently set up a wireframes kit for the PMs to start using Galaxy in their idea formulation in Figma and the team has taken a liken to this.</p>
